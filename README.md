## Predicting Employee Attrition

As a former manager, I am inherently interested in personnel questions.  One of the big ones has always been: can you predict who is going to leave?  I came across this attrition dataset kindly provided to the data science community by IBM.  This project is my personal look at the data, along with model building to predict who might be an attrition risk.

### Project Structure
I do my coding in Python .py files.  However, to provide an explaination, or narration to my work, I am experimenting with including notebooks (.ipynb) files to walk people thru the code.  

The project breakdown is:
1) Attrition_EDA.py - the exploratory data analysis created to give me an overview of the data
  * Explanatory_EDA_Notebook.ipynb - the notebook explaining the thinking behind the EDA
2) Evaluate_models.py - try several different candidate models and compare the RMSE.  Use this to select the model to refine
  * Explanatory_eval.ipynb - TBD.  Will cover the thinking behind the candidate models and the eval process
3) Attrition_models.py - TBD 
  * Explanatory_Models.ipynb - TBD once I have the models built
4) Report_WrapUp - TBD.  I plan to write-up the results of this analysis, just as I'd have to do if this were an actual task at work.

#### Note to self: add clustering, I think that would be interesting to explore for this dataset
