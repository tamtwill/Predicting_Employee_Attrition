## Predicting Employee Attrition

As a former manager, I am inherently interested in personnel questions.  One of the big ones has always been: can you predict who is going to leave?  I came across this attrition dataset kindly provided to the data science community by IBM.  This project is just my personal look at the data, along with model building.

### Project Structure
I do my coding in Python .py files.  However, to provide an explaination, or narration to my work, I am experimenting with including notebooks (.ipynb) files to walk people thru the code.  

The project breakdown is:
1) Attrition_EDA.py - the exploratory data analysis created to give me an overview of the data
  * Explanatory_EDA_Notebook.ipynb - the notebook explaining the thinking behind the EDA
2) Attrition_models.py - TBD 
  * Explanatory_Models.ipynb - TBD once I have the models built
3) Report_WrapUp - TBD.  I plan to write-up the results of this analysis, just as I'd have to do if this were an actual task at work.
